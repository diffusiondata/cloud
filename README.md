Amazon EC2
==========

Push Technology has created an Amazon EC2 image for their flagship data distribution product, Diffusion.
This repository contains examples that can be run on that EC2 image and also provides a starter guide that shows
you how to create, deploy and operate an 
application that demostrates the power of Diffusion. 
The application will tranform data from a data source and publish the data, via Diffusion running in the EC2 Cloud, 
to any net connected device.

The starter guide can be located in the following location:
