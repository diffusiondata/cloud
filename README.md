Amazon EC2
==========

Push Technology has created an Amazon EC2 image for their flagship data distribution product, Diffusion.
This repository contains examples that can be run on that EC2 image and also provides a starter guide that shows
you how to create, deploy and operate an 
application that demostrates the power of Diffusion. 
The application will tranform data from a data source and publish the data, via Diffusion running in the EC2 Cloud, 
to any net connected device.

The starter guide can be located in the following location:

  https://github.com/pushtechnology/cloud/blob/master/The%20Diffusion%20Amazon%20EC2%20Starter%20Guide.pdf

Build Instructions
==================

These samples can be built from Eclipse.
From Eclipse with both EGit and the Diffusion Tools installed you can import this Git repository.
This should create these samples as Eclipse projects that should build successfuly.
They can then be exported as JAR files as described in the starter guide.
